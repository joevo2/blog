You are here either because you’ve been doing research about me or you are browsing some old post in this blog because of an interesting article that I’ve posted. 😏 

This post will serve as an introduction on why and how I started this blog. The main reason that I have started this blog is for it to serve as a public space where I can write down my thoughts, coding related post or about anything that I personally have interest on be it AI or AR. Pontentially even hosting a podcast right here.

For starter I would start with how I created this blog and how you can do it as well.

### Tech Stack

- Hugo 
- GitHub for hosting the Hugo repo
- Netlify for hosting the site

Originally I wanted to start a Medium blog instead of reinventing the wheel. Thanks to our dear beloved Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak. Medium, with its wonderful engineering blog post and inspiring article are DNS blocked in Malaysia. Yeah of course I can by pass it with my own DNS but fellow Malaysian wouldn't be able to read it 😢

Alternative like the “self-hosted” Medium like blogging platform Ghost needs a proper server environment to run it. It would either cost like 5USD/month hosted by Ghost them or free using Heroku but with all the troublesome stuff associated with it like setting up a brand new account as well as New Relic to ping it to ensure the blog doesn’t go to sleep every 30 min and taking up to a minute to wake up to serve you a humble post.
