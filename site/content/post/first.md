You are here either because you’ve been doing research about me or you have been browsing some old post in this blog because of an interesting article that I’ve posted. 😏 

This post will serve as an introduction on why and how (technical aspect) I started this blog. 

## Why? 
The main reason that I have started this blog is for it to serve as a public space. A place where I can write down my thoughts, coding related post or just about anything that I personally have interest on, be it AI or AR. In the future I might even host a podcast right.

## How? 
### Backstory
Originally, I wanted to just start a Medium blog instead of reinventing the wheel. Thanks to our dear beloved Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. Medium, with its wonderful engineering blog post and inspiring article are DNS blocked in Malaysia. Yeah... of course I can by pass it with my Google DNS but my fellow Malaysian wouldn't be able to read it 😢

Alternatives like the “self-hosted” Medium like blogging platform Ghost needs a proper server environment to run it. It would either cost like 5USD/month hosted by Ghost or free using Heroku but with all the troublesome stuff associated with it like setting up a brand new account as well as New Relic to ping it to ensure the blog doesn’t go to sleep every 30 min and taking up to a minute to wake up to serve you a humble post.
### The Tech Stack
- Hugo 
- GitHub for hosting the Hugo repo
- Netlify for hosting the site

My CTO in Vase.ai shared to us this [https://jamstack.org/](https://jamstack.org/) and I was enlighten on how powerful static site can be with the power of React and Vue. I personally had done a couple of small site with GitHub Pages so I'm kinda familiar on how fast static site can be. 

Here are some of the [example](https://jamstack.org/examples/) in shown in JAM Stack. 

Then I started my journey on building my own version of it. I wanted a proper online presences where people can get all the information they want about me, by me. Instead of humiliating and adolescence silly post that I've scattered throughout the internet.
