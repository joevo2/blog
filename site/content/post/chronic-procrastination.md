I always thought that my dad was wrong. "No I did not sleep and expect the issues will get solved by itself, I totally did not...", I said to myself deep within.

But do I?

I love to take on projects. From calendar that upgrade your life, to [tinder food app ](https://github.com/getsambal/sambal)that are supposed to solve all your "what to eat dilemma", to [farmbot](https://farmbot.io/) that would democratise farmers access to modern technology, to kickstarting a titanium pen, to freelancing various of web and application development.

It really do seems like I'm a person that love to take on adventure and building awesome stuff. 

But did I even completed them? Did any one of those came out successful? or even at come out at a usable form? LOL

Anyhow this is quite a nice article for fellow procrastinator out there. Hope it change your life at least by a bit. By taming the [Instant Gratification Monkey,](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html)
