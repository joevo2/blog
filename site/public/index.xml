      <description>You are here either because you‚Äôve been doing research about me or you have been browsing some old post in this blog because of an interesting article that I‚Äôve posted. üòè
This post will serve as an introduction on why and how (technical aspect) I started this blog.
Why? The main reason that I have started this blog is for it to serve as a personal space. A space where I can write down my thoughts, coding related post or just about anything that I personally have interest on, be it AI or AR plus maybe a podcast of my own in the not too far future.</description>
